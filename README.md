# Solace: Notes

The goal of this project is to create a notes application allowing for users
to perform CRUD actions on a collection of notes.

Per the assignment summary:

> Solace has a feature that allows advocates to create notes on both their individual client appointments and contract work they perform for the client. A simple feature that has proven very valuable for advocates to solidify all their information inside one application that they can then share with their clients as they see fit.
